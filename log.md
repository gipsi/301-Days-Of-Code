# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Gipsi's Code Log

### Day 213: [01-08-2017]

**Today's Progress:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript Tutorial with MDN. Figuring out how to use JSON and API's for FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts:** Making things helps me understand. I learnt how to organise files for a website, tried the Brackets text editor for the first time, used Mozilla Developer browser and started rebuilding my personal web page.
